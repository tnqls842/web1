<h2>CSS</h2>
<p>Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present
  the same markup page in different styles for different rendering methods,
  such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader),
  and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting
  if the content is accessed on a mobile device
